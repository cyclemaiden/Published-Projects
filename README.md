# Sheepbun Monster's Published Projects

Hi! If you're reading this, you've stumbled upon my small repository of projects that I've decided to make open source.

Everything here is licensed under GNU GPLv3. See the license file for more details. Basically you can do whatever you want with what you find here, except distribute closed source versions. Also, attribution to me is required under that license if you do end up using any of my code. Thanks!

Right now there is exactly one project: Tabletop Dice Roller. It's a dice roller software written in Python designed for use with tabletop role playing games. It lets you use dice of any number of sides in any multiple. It can also sum together multiple dice rolls and any modifiers you might want to add. See the README in that folder for more info.
